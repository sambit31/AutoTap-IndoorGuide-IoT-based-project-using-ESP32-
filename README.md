> **Empowering independence through accessible technology.** A comprehensive IoT solution that combines indoor navigation and smart water control systems specifically designed for the visually impaired.

## 📑 Project Overview

This repository contains two complementary ESP32-based solutions that work together to enhance accessibility and independence for visually impaired individuals:

1. **🌐 Indoor Navigation System** - A mesh network of ESP32 devices that provides GPS-like positioning indoors
2. **🚰 AutoTap System** - A touchless water control system with both proximity and voice activation

Both systems incorporate voice-first interfaces powered by AI to create a seamless, hands-free user experience without requiring constant internet connectivity.

## 🏆 Key Benefits

- **Enhanced Independence** - Navigate indoor spaces and control water fixtures without assistance
- **Multimodal Interfaces** - Voice, proximity, and mobile app control options
- **Safety-Focused Design** - Reduce accidents with hands-free operation and obstacle detection
- **Low-Cost Implementation** - Affordable components make adoption accessible
- **Open-Source Architecture** - Customizable for different environments and needs
- **No Constant Internet Required** - Core functionality works offline

## 🧩 System Components

### 🌐 Indoor Navigation System
The navigation system creates a wireless mesh network that:
- Tracks user position in real-time without GPS or WiFi infrastructure
- Provides voice-guided navigation through indoor spaces
- Creates a self-healing network that's resilient to node failures
- Visualizes position data for caregivers or system administrators

### 🚰 AutoTap System
The water control system offers:
- Touchless water activation through IR proximity sensing
- Voice command control via Gemini AI
- WiFi connectivity for integration with the broader system
- Low power operation for extended battery life
- Dual input modes for redundancy and reliability

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Hardware**
  - ESP32 microcontrollers
  - IR proximity sensors
  - 5V water pumps with relay control
  - Power management components (buck converters)
  - Optional: ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection

- **Software**
  - Arduino (C/C++) for ESP32 firmware
  - painlessMesh for wireless mesh networking
  - Python for visualization and voice processing
  - Gemini AI for natural language understanding
  - Text-to-speech and speech recognition libraries

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Arduino IDE with ESP32 board support
- Python 3.x with required libraries
- Gemini API key (for voice interfaces)
- ESP32 development boards (3+ for navigation, 1 for AutoTap)
- Electronic components as listed in each system's README

### Quick Start Guide

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sambit31/AutoTap-IndoorGuide-IoT-based-project-using-ESP32-.git
   cd AutoTap-IndoorGuide
   ```

2. **Set up the Indoor Navigation System**
   ```bash
   cd MeshNetwork
   # Follow instructions in MeshNetwork/README.md
   ```

3. **Set up the AutoTap System**
   ```bash
   cd ../AutoTap
   # Follow instructions in AutoTap/README.md
   ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables**
