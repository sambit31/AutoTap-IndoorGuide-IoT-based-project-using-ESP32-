# 🚰 AutoTap System – Smart Touchless Water Control

## 🔍 Overview

AutoTap is a smart, touchless water control system designed for **visually impaired individuals** and general hands-free hygiene use. It utilizes **dual input modes** — **IR sensor-based hand detection** and **voice command via Gemini AI (Python)** — to control a 5V water pump using an ESP32 microcontroller. This system offers safety, automation, and accessibility in daily water usage environments such as kitchens, bathrooms, or public restrooms.

## 🎯 Key Features

- ✋ **IR Sensor Activation** – Detects hand presence to trigger water flow
- 🎙️ **Voice Command Control** – Voice-based tap control using Gemini and Python
- 📶 **Wi-Fi Based Communication** – ESP32 receives voice control commands wirelessly
- 🔌 **Low Power Efficient** – Uses buck converter and relay for safe operation
- 👁️‍🗨️ **Designed for Visually Impaired** – Enables hands-free interaction
- 🔄 **Dual Mode Operation** – Works even if one input mode fails

## ⚡ Circuit Connections

➤ **IR Sensor to ESP32:**
- VCC → 3.3V
- GND → GND
- OUT → GPIO 4

➤ **Relay Module:**
- IN → GPIO 5
- VCC → VIN (from buck converter)
- GND → GND
- Pump V+ → Relay NO
- Pump V– → Ground

➤ **Buck Converter:**
- Input → 2 Batteries (7.4V)
- Output → 5V (To ESP32 VIN and Relay)

➤ **Python Voice Assistant:**
- Python script uses Gemini to interpret voice
- Sends HTTP requests to ESP32 to toggle pump
- ESP32 runs server that listens for /on or /off

---

## 🚀 How It Works

- Hand Detected by IR Sensor → ESP32 turns pump ON.
- Voice Command "Turn on tap" → Gemini interprets → Python sends signal → ESP32 activates relay → Water flows.

ESP32 runs combined logic:

```cpp
if (digitalRead(IR_PIN) == HIGH || voiceCommand == "on") {
    digitalWrite(RELAY_PIN, HIGH);
} else if (voiceCommand == "off") {
    digitalWrite(RELAY_PIN, LOW);
}
```

## 🧪 Usage Instructions

1. Connect all components as per circuit above.
2. Upload main.ino to ESP32 using Arduino IDE.
3. Run voice_assistant.py on your PC with internet.
4. Speak voice commands: "Turn on tap", "Stop water", etc.
5. Place hand in front of IR sensor to test automatic activation.

## 🧱 Project Modules

- main.ino – C++ code on ESP32 for IR + relay control
- voice_assistant.py – Voice interface (Gemini + Python)
- .env – Contains Gemini and Wi-Fi credentials

---

## 🧠 Real-Life Applications

- Visually impaired-friendly bathrooms
- Touchless faucets in public spaces
- Kitchen taps for hygiene
- Smart home water control systems

---

## ❗ Limitations

- Requires stable Wi-Fi for voice commands
- Voice assistant runs separately on a computer or Raspberry Pi
- Gemini API usage may have limits depending on plan

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Integrate voice module directly into ESP32
- Add water usage monitoring via flow sensor
- Mobile app for remote monitoring and analytics
